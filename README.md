# Pytorch Seq2seq

Built a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with an attention mechanism for machine translation. Implemented beam search and nucleus sampling strategies for decoding.

For more details please look at `report.pdf`

## Getting Started

Note: This repo only works with torchtext 0.9 or above which requires PyTorch 1.8 or above. If you are using torchtext 0.8 then please use [this](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/tree/torchtext08) branch

This repo contains implemention of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) 1.8, [torchtext](https://github.com/pytorch/text) 0.9 and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) 3.0,  using Python 3.8.
